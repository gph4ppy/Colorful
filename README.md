# Colorful

Colorful is an application for graphic designers, programmers, and normal users who use Discord. Thanks to this tool, you can have all your favorite colors at hand, and you can see what the roles will look like on Discord without turning it on.

Colorful includes many functions, such as:
  - Dark mode.
  - Previewing and saving selected color.
  - Copying color values with the right-click.
  - Previewing and saving color palettes. 
  - You can also copy the values of the entire palette and individual items.
  - A tool that allows you to preview what the role will look like on Discord. You can enter a rank name, user nickname, and a message of up to 100 characters.

### Informations: 
- **This app is not related to Discord. It is only a concept for a portfolio. The author of Colorful has no profits - this is only the realization of an idea that will be used in private (if it is used at all). The application is not generally available, and the reference to Discord is not marketing/advertising.**
- Colorful is currently created only for MacOS devices.
- The project is ended. 
- You can resize the window by stretching from any corner.
- To switch dark mode, go to the settings and click a toggle button.
- To copy the information, right-click in the area of information. A special menu will appear from which you can select options.
